And the sound of his own breathing was holding him fast. The vision of Goa, and every single thing in it, had palled. The excitement of the waiting experiences had crumbled - was crumbling - into moments, that did not cohere. Instead, each moment felt slow, cloying, dreary, pointless, intolerable. Intolerable: the prickliness of the sun outdoors, the heaviness in the stomach after a meal was done, the waiting around at pumps to fill petrol, the waiting for food, the waiting for taxis, the myriad annoying things other people would say or do, the various times the girls would not be simply sexy and pliant, but demanding and contradictory. 
All the dead time. He saw it vividly. What else was there to see?
